# Image Retrieval with SimCLR and Supervised Contrastive Learning

## Project Overview

This project explores different approaches to image retrieval, comparing the effectiveness of ResNet-50 (pretrained with SimCLR) with FaceNet on both a competition dataset and the Intel Image Classification dataset. Through our experiments, we demonstrate how dataset domain similarity and data availability significantly impact model performance. While ResNet-50 (SimCLR) struggles with limited face image data, it excels on the Intel dataset due to better domain alignment with its ImageNet pretraining.

## Features

- Comparative analysis of different image retrieval approaches:
  - ResNet-50 pretrained with SimCLR (with and without fine-tuning)
  - FaceNet pretrained model evaluation
  - EfficientNet
  - Performance comparison on both limited and large-scale datasets
- Implementation of Supervised Contrastive Learning for fine-tuning
- Comprehensive evaluation framework:
  - Top-k retrieval accuracy metrics
  - Per-class performance analysis
  - t-SNE visualization of embedding spaces
- Visual result analysis with query-retrieval pairs
- Support for both competition data and Intel Image Classification dataset

## How it Works

1. **Feature Learning Pipeline**:
   - Baseline evaluation with pretrained models (SimCLR ResNet50 and FaceNet)
   - Fine-tuning experiments with Supervised Contrastive Loss
   - Performance validation on larger Intel Image dataset

2. **Image Retrieval Process**:
   - Extract feature embeddings using the selected model
   - Compute cosine similarity between query and gallery images
   - Return the most similar images based on similarity scores
   - Evaluate retrieval accuracy using class labels

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Measure top-k retrieval score (9.55 to 781 on competition data)
   - Demonstrate dramatic improvement with sufficient data (63% to 98.78% on Intel dataset)
   - Visualize embedding space organization using t-SNE
   - Analyze per-class performance and retrieval examples

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- ipykernel==6.29.5
- matplotlib==3.10.3
- torchvision==0.22.0+cu128
- tqdm==4.67.1
- wandb==0.19.11

## Model Architecture

We experimented with three different approaches:

1. **ResNet-50 with SimCLR Pretraining**:
   - Backbone: ResNet-50 pretrained using SimCLR on ImageNet
   - No fine-tuning, used as baseline
   - Best suited for: Natural image datasets similar to ImageNet domain

2. **FaceNet Pretrained**:
   - Used pretrained FaceNet model
   - Direct evaluation on competition dataset without fine-tuning
   - Specialized for face recognition tasks
   - Better suited for: Face-specific image retrieval

3. **SimCLR Fine-tuned with SupCon**:
   - ResNet-50 backbone with SimCLR pretraining
   - Fine-tuned using Supervised Contrastive Loss
   - Projection Head: MLP with structure [2048 → 512 → 128]
   - Optimized for: Better feature learning on target dataset

3. **EfficientNet Fine-Tuned**:

   - EfficientNet-B0 backbone pretrained on ImageNet
   - Fine-tuned on competition dataset with cross-entropy loss and label smoothing
   - Classification head replaced with a linear layer matching number of classes
   - Optimized for: Compact yet accurate visual feature extraction with fast inference

This architecture comparison revealed how model performance is heavily influenced by the alignment between pretraining domain and target dataset characteristics.

## Results and Performance

Our experimental workflow consisted of three main phases:

1. **Initial Evaluation on Competition Data**:
   - Evaluated pretrained SimCLR (ResNet-50 backbone) - achieved 9.55 score
   - Evaluated pretrained FaceNet model - achieved 781 score
   - FaceNet showed significantly better performance without any fine-tuning

2. **Competition Data Fine-tuning Analysis**:
   - Fine-tuned SimCLR model using SupCon loss on competition data
   - After 100 epochs, achieved 18 score
   - Training dynamics analysis revealed instability:
     - Initial phase: Loss decreased from around 3.7 to ~2.45 by epoch 20
     - Significant instability around epochs 21-27:
       - Sharp spike starting at epoch 21 (about 3.86)
       - Peaked at epoch 22 (4.59)
       - Gradual recovery to ~3.7 by epoch 26
     - This unstable behavior suggests fundamental issues:
       - Extreme class imbalance (some classes having only 1 example)
       - Insufficient positive pairs for contrastive learning
       - Domain mismatch between SimCLR's natural image pretraining and face recognition task
   - Results suggested this approach was unsuiPr 2table for such a small, imbalanced face dataset

3. **Intel Image Dataset Validation**:
   - To verify our approach wasn't fundamentally flawed, we switched to the larger Intel Image Classification dataset
   - Initial evaluation with pretrained SimCLR showed strong 68.8% accuracy, likely due to:
     - Intel dataset's similarity to ImageNet's general-purpose nature
     - Better alignment with SimCLR's pretraining on natural images
     - Sufficient examples per class for effective contrastive learning
   - After fine-tuning with SupCon loss, achieved excellent 97.77% accuracy
   - This dramatic improvement confirmed our hypothesis that the poor performance on the competition dataset was due to:
     - Extreme data scarcity
     - Domain mismatch (faces vs natural images)
     - Insufficient positive pairs for contrastive learning

### Key Findings

1. **Model-Data Compatibility**: 
   - FaceNet's superior performance (781 vs SimCLR's 9.55) demonstrates the importance of using domain-specific pretrained models for limited face data
   - SimCLR+SupCon performs exceptionally well (97.77%) when domain and data requirements are met
   - EfficientNet Fine-Tuned achieves strong performance (85.01%) by combining architectural efficiency with domain-specific fine-tuning, making it ideal when both accuracy and computational cost matter.
2. **Data Requirements for SupCon**: Training dynamics revealed that Supervised Contrastive Learning requires:
   - Multiple examples per class to create positive pairs
   - Reasonably balanced class distribution
   - Domain alignment with the pretraining dataset

3. **Solution Validation**: While the approach struggled with the face dataset, its success on the Intel dataset (97.77%) validates that SimCLR+SupCon is highly effective when these requirements are met

### Model Performance Comparison

The first three results on the competition data is based on the evaluation metrics given on the competition (the evaluation server results).

| Model Configuration | Dataset | Accuracy (%) | Notes |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| EfficientNet (Fine-Tuned) | Competition Data | 85.01 | High accuracy with minimal parameters; benefits from domain-specific fine-tuning |
| FaceNet (pretrained, no fine-tuning) | Competition Data | 781 | Best performance on competition data |
| ResNet-50 (SimCLR pretrained) | Competition Data | 9.55 | Initial baseline, domain mismatch |
| ResNet-50 (SimCLR + 50 epochs SupCon) | Competition Data | 18 | Limited by extremely scarce data (1 image/class) |
| ResNet-50 (SimCLR pretrained) | Intel Image | Top-3: 68.8 | Strong baseline due to dataset similarity with ImageNet |
| ResNet-50 (SimCLR + SupCon fine-tuned) | Intel Image | Top-3: 97.77 | Excellent performance with sufficient data |

Note: The performance differences can be attributed to two key factors:

1. Dataset Domain: SimCLR's pretrained weights performed better on Intel dataset (68.8%) versus competition data (9.55 (though its score)) due to its similarity with ImageNet-style natural images
2. Training Data Availability: The competition dataset's extreme scarcity (some example contain 1 image per class) severely limited fine-tuning potential, while the Intel dataset provided sufficient examples for effective learning
